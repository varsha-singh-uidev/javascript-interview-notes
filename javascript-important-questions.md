##### Interview Questions ##### 

Interviewer: What is a scripting language?
You: A scripting language is a programming language that doesn’t need to be compiled into machine code first. Instead, it’s interpreted line by line when the program runs. This makes it easier to write small programs quickly, automate tasks, and add features to websites or applications. Examples include JavaScript, Python, and PHP.
 
Interviewer: Can you explain client-side scripting? 
You: Client-side scripting means the code runs in the user’s browser, on their computer. It’s mainly used to make web pages interactive and responsive. For example, when you click a button and the page changes instantly without reloading, that’s client-side scripting. JavaScript is the most common language here. It handles things like form validation, animations, and dynamic page updates.

Interviewer: And what about server-side scripting?
You: Server-side scripting runs on the web server before the page is sent to the browser. It’s used for tasks that need access to databases or secure information. For example, when you log in to a website, the server-side script checks your username and password against the database. Languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js are often used.

Interviewer: So what’s the main difference between the two? 
You: Client-side scripting focuses on what the user sees and interacts with directly in their browser. Server-side scripting focuses on behind-the-scenes work like storing data, processing requests, and sending back results.

Interviewer: Why does console.log(5 + "2") give "52"?
You: In JavaScript, the + operator is special. If one of the values is a string, JavaScript converts the other value into a string too and then concatenates them. So 5 becomes "5", and "5" + "2" results in "52".

Interviewer: Then why does console.log(5 - "2") give 3? 
You: Unlike +, the - operator only works with numbers. So JavaScript tries to convert both values into numbers. "2" becomes 2, and 5 - 2 gives 3.

Interviewer: How do you check if a value is NaN in JavaScript? You: There are two main ways:
1.	Using isNaN(value) → This checks if the value is Not a Number.
          isNaN("hello"); // true             isNaN(123);  // false
2.	Using Number.isNaN(value) → This is stricter. It only returns true if the value is exactly NaN.
     Number.isNaN(NaN); // true    Number.isNaN("hello"); //false

Interview: What values are considered falsy in JavaScript? 
You: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN

Interviewer: What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
You: undefined → It means a variable has been declared but not assigned any value yet. 
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
•	null → It is an intentional empty value. Developers assign null to show that a variable should be empty. 
let y = null;
console.log(y); // null

Interview: What is the output of typeof function() {}?
You: "function"

Interviewer: How do you convert a number to a string in JavaScript? 
You:
•	Using .toString() method:
let num = 123;
console.log(num.toString()); // "123"
•	Using String() function:
String(123); // "123"
•	Or by concatenating with an empty string:
123 + ""; // "123"

Interviewer: And how do you convert a string to a number? 
You:
•	Using Number() function:
Number("123"); // 123

•	Using parseInt() for integers:
parseInt("123"); // 123
•	Or with the unary + operator:
+"123"; // 123

## DOM Related Question ##

Q: What is querySelector()?
A:  querySelector() is a DOM method in JavaScript that returns the first element within the document that matches      a given CSS selector. If no matching element is found, it returns null.

Q: What is querySelectorAll()?
A:  querySelectorAll() is a DOM method in JavaScript that returns all elements in the document that match a given CSS selector.
•	Unlike querySelector(), which returns only the first match, querySelectorAll() returns all matches.

Q: How to change an attribute? 
A: Attributes in the DOM are name–value pairs inside HTML tags that provide extra information about elements.
element.setAttribute("attr", "value");
You can use getAttribute() to read the value of an attribute from an element.
You can use removeAttribute() to delete an attribute from an element.

Q: How to remove an element?
A: Use the element.remove() method to delete an element from the DOM.

Q: How to replace an element?
A: Use parent.replaceChild(newNode, oldNode) to replace an existing child element with a new one.

Q: What is classList?
A: classList is a property of DOM elements that provides methods to add = element.classList.add(), 
Remove = element.classList.remove(), 
Toggle = element.classList.toggle(), 
check CSS classes = element.classList.contains().

Q: What is the event object?
A: The event object is automatically passed to event handler functions in JavaScript. It contains information about the triggered event, such as the type of event, the target element, mouse coordinates, key pressed, etc.

Q: What is event.target?
A: event.target refers to the element that actually triggered the event.

Q: What is event.currentTarget?
A: event.currentTarget refers to the element the event listener is attached to (the one currently handling the event).

Q: What is once option in event listener? Explain that with the help of example.
A: What is the once option in Event Listener?
•	When you attach an event listener using addEventListener(), you can pass an options object.
•	One of those options is once: true.
•	Meaning: The event listener will run only once — after it executes the first time, it is automatically removed.
•	This is useful when you want an action to happen a single time (e.g., onboarding popup, one time animation         trigger, or logging a unique event).
  Example => let button = document.querySelector("#btn");
  button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button clicked!"); }, { once: true });

Q: What’s the difference between the input and change events in JavaScript?
A: The input and change events are both used to detect user interactions with form elements, but they behave differently:
•	input event: Fires immediately whenever the value of an input changes — for example, on every keystroke in a text box.
•	change event: Fires only after the element loses focus (blur) and the value has been modified. For dropdowns or checkboxes, it fires as soon as the selection or state changes.

Q: Can events be triggered manually?
A: Yes. In JavaScript, events can be triggered manually using methods like element.click() or by creating and         dispatching custom events with dispatchEvent(). 

   Example 1: Trigger a Built‑in Event
   <button id="btn">Click Me</button>
   <script>
     let button = document.querySelector("#btn");
     // Attach listener
     button.addEventListener("click", () => { console.log("Button clicked!"); });
     // Trigger event manually
     button.click(); // Logs "Button clicked!"
   </script>

   Example 2: Trigger a Custom Event
   let div = document.querySelector("#myDiv");

   // Attach listener
   div.addEventListener("customEvent", () => { console.log("Custom event triggered!"); });

   // Create and dispatch custom event
   let event = new Event("customEvent");
   div.dispatchEvent(event); // Logs "Custom event triggered!"

Q:  What is BOM?
A:  BOM(Browser Object Model) is a part of Javascript that lets you interact with the browser window.
    It gives you access the things like: 
    window → the browser window
    location → the current URL
    history → the browser’s back/forward history
    navigator → browser info (like user agent)
    screen → screen size and resolution

Q: How to reload a page? 
A: location.reload() 

Q: How to redirect to another URL? 
A: location.href = "https://example.com"

Q: How to go back one page? 
A: history.back() 

Q: How to go forward one page? 
A: history.forward()
    
Q: What is console.table()? 
A: Logs data in tabular format. 

Q: What is console.warn()? 
A: Logs a warning message. 

Q: What is console.time() and console.timeEnd()? 
A: Measures execution time of code. 

Q: How to open a new browser window? 
A: Using window.open("url")

## Question Related to the OOP's ##

Q: What is class?
A: A JS class is blueprint for creating the objects. It encapsulates the data and method together. Class are built on the top of prototype, but they use a more familiar object-oriented syntax. They support inheritance, encapsulation and reusability.
Example: class ClassName{}

Q: Can constructors be overloaded in JS?
A: No, JS does not support the constructor overloading. Only one constructor per class.

Q: What is encapsulation in OOP? 
A: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class). 

Q: What is abstraction in OOP? 
A: Hiding complex details and showing only essential 
features.

Q: What are private class fields?
A: Private class fields in JavaScript are properties of a class that are declared with a # prefix. They are accessible only inside the class and cannot be read or modified directly from outside. This enforces encapsulation and protects internal state.
Example: class BankAccount {
  #balance = 0; // private field

  deposit(amount) { this.#balance += amount; }

  getBalance() { return this.#balance; }
}

const account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(100);
console.log(account.getBalance()); //  100
console.log(account.#balance);     //  Error: private field not accessible

Q: What is a mixin? 
A: A mixin is a reusable object that contain methods or features. We can share those methods across multiple objects and classes. Instead of using the inheritance which can bring in the unwanted properties. We can use the mixin to copy only the behaviour we need.
Example: 
let mixin = { greet(){console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);} }

class Human{
    constructor(name){ this.name = name; }
}
Object.assign(Human.prototype, mixin);
let h = new Human("Rahul");
h.greet();

Q: Can you define a method outside the class?
A: Yes. In JavaScript, you can define a method outside the class and then attach it to the class’s prototype. This way, all instances of the class can use it, even though it wasn’t written inside the class body.

Q: What are getters and setters?
A: Getter (get) → A special method in a class/object that lets you access a property’s value.
Setter (set) → A special method that lets you update or modify a property’s value safely.
Example:
class Person{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    // getter function
    get Age(){ return this.age; } 
    // setter function
    set Age(newAge){
        if(newAge > 0){ this.age = newAge; }
        else{ console.log("Invalid age"); }
    }
}
const p = new Person("Varsha", 20);
console.log(p.Age);
p.Age = 21;
console.log(p.Age);

## Function Related Question ##

Interviewer: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?
You: An anonymous function is simply a function without a name. Instead of declaring it with a name, we define it directly where it’s needed.
•	It’s often used as a callback (passed into another function).
•	It helps when you don’t need to reuse the function elsewhere.
setTimeout(function() { console.log("run after 1 sec"); }, 1000);

Interviewer: What is a callback function in JavaScript? 
You: A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and it gets executed later, usually after some task is finished.
•	It’s often used for asynchronous operations like waiting for data, timers, or events.
function welcome () {console.log (`welcome, again`);}
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log(`hello ${name}`); callback(); }
greet("varsha", welcome);

Interviewer: Can arrow functions be used as constructors in JavaScript?
 You: No, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
•	Constructors in JavaScript are functions that can be called with the new keyword to create object instances.
•	Arrow functions do not have their own this binding and do not have a prototype property.
•	Because of this, they cannot be used with new. Attempting to do so throws an error.
Example = const Person = (name) => { this.name = name;};
const p = new Person("Varsha"); // TypeError: Person is not a constructor

Interviewer: What is a higher order function in JavaScript? 
You: A higher order function (HOF) is a function that either:
1.	Takes another function as an argument, or
2.	Returns a function as its result.
This makes functions in JavaScript first class citizens — they can be passed around just like variables.
•	Useful for callbacks, event handling, array methods, and function composition.
•	Makes code more reusable and expressive.
A higher order function is the one that receives or returns functions.
 A callback is the function that gets passed into a higher order function.

Q: Are function expressions hoisted?
A: No, only declarations are hoisted.

Interview: What is the argument object?
You: The arguments object in JavaScript
•	It’s something you get inside normal functions (not arrow functions).
•	It holds all the values you passed when you called the function.
•	It looks like an array, but it’s not a real array. You can use arguments[0], arguments[1], and arguments.length.
Example = function showArgs(a, b) {
console.log(arguments[0]); // first value 
console.log(arguments [1]); // second value console.log(arguments.length); // how many values passed } showArgs(10, 20);

Q: What is the use of rest parameters?
A: To accept unlimited arguments as an array.

Q: Why use IIFE?
A: To create private scopes and avoid polluting global scope.

Q: Can IIFE return values? 
A: Yes: let result = (() => 5 + 2)();

Q: What is memoization? 
A: Caching function results to improve performance. 

Q: What is function currying? 
A: Currying means breaking a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument at a time.
Example = function multiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b; }; }
const double = multiply(2); 
console.log(double(5)); // 10

Q: What are pure functions? 
A: Functions with no side effects and consistent output for the same input. They are predictable and easier to test.
console.log() is a side effect because it changes something outside the function (it prints to the console).
function add(a, b) {  return a + b; }
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5 (always same result)

Q: What is an impure function? 
A: A function that modifies external variables or has side effects.
let count = 0;
function increase() {  count++; // changes external state
  return count; }
console.log(increase()); // 1
console.log(increase()); // 2

Q: Can you redefine a function? 
A: Yes, last definition overrides the earlier ones.
Example = let saySomething = function() {
console.log("First version"); }
saySomething(); // "First version"
// Redefine by assigning a new function
saySomething = function() {console.log("Second version"); };
saySomething(); // "Second version"

Q: Can you use arrow functions inside objects? 
A: Yes, but they don’t have their own this.

Q: Can arrow functions be methods?
A: Not recommended, due to lack of this.

Q: What is lexical scope?
A: Variables are accessible based on where they are written in the code, not how functions are called. Lexical scope is static: decided at the time you write the code. This is the foundation of closures in JavaScript (functions remembering variables from their outer scope).

Q: What is the difference between static and dynamic scoping?
A:  Static (Lexical) Scoping
•	Variable scope is decided at compile time (when code is written).
•	Inner functions can access variables from their outer functions because of their position in the code.
•	JavaScript uses static scoping.
Dynamic Scoping
•	Variable scope is decided at runtime (when the function is called).
•	The interpreter looks at the call stack to find variables.
•	Languages like Lisp (older versions) or Perl (with certain settings) can use dynamic scoping.
•	JavaScript does not use dynamic scoping.

Q: Can you await multiple promises? 
A: Yes, use Promise.all() with await.

Q: Can generator functions be asynchronous? 
A: Yes, use async function*.

Q: What is a closure? 
A: A function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has returned. Closure can be created with the arrow function. If closure are not managed properly they cause the memory leaks.
Example = function outer () {let count = 0;
    return function () {count++;    console.log(count);}}
    let a = outer ();        a ();

Q: What is the use of closures?
A: To create private variables or encapsulation.

Q: What is the difference between the function chaining and the method chaining?
A: Function Chaining
Explanation:
•	In function chaining, each function call returns something that can be called again.
•	This could be another function (like in currying) or this (the same object).
•	It allows you to keep calling functions one after another without breaking the chain.
 
Method Chaining
Explanation:
•	In method chaining, you work with an object.
•	Each method returns the object itself (this), so you can immediately call another method on it.
•	This is common in libraries like jQuery and Promises.

class Calculator {
  constructor() {this.value = 0;}
  add(n) {   this.value += n;
    return this;   // return object for chaining
  }
  multiply(n) {  this.value *= n;  return this; }
}
const result = new Calculator().add(5).multiply(2)value;
console.log(result); 

Q: Can you use new Function () constructor? 
A: Yes, but it’s not recommended due to security and performance issues.

Q: Can functions be used with classes? 
A: Yes, as methods(working on the objects) or static functions(functions tied to the class itself).

Q: What is a tail call? 
A: A function call that happens as the last action in a function.

Q: Does JavaScript support tail call optimization? 
A: Some engines do, but not universally supported.

Q: Can you delete a function?
A:  In JavaScript, functions declared normally (with function) cannot be deleted because they are not configurable properties.
•	But if a function is assigned to an object property or assign to the variable, you can delete it by (or reassign it to null).
let obj = {
  greet: function() { console.log("Hello!"); }
};
delete obj.greet; // deletes the property
console.log(obj.greet); // undefined

Q: Can you clone a function? 
A: Not directly, but you can copy its reference.
function greet () {console.log("Hello");}
const copy = greet; // copy points to the same function
copy();  greet(); 

Q: Can functions have properties?
A: Yes, functions can have properties because they are objects in JavaScript.
function greet(){ console.log("hello"); }
greet.lang = "Eng";
console.log(greet.lang);

Q: What is the arity of a function?
A:  Arity of a Function
•	The arity of a function is the number of arguments (parameters) that the function expects.
•	In JavaScript, you can check a function’s arity using the (.length) property.

Example = function add(a,b){ console.log(a+b); }
console.log(add.length);

Q: What is a named function expression? 
A: A function expression with a name: 
const fn = function named() {};

Q: Can arrow function return objects directly?
A: yes, Arrow function can return object directly, but you must wrap the object in parantheses. Note-> without the parantheses, JavaScript interprests {} as a function 
   body, not the object literal.
   Exmaple: const greet = () => {name : "bob"};
            console.log(greet()); //undefined
       //correct way to return the object
       const greet = () => {name : "bob"};
       console.log(greet());

Q: Do arrow functions have their own super?
A: No, Arrow functions do not have their own super (just like they don’t have their own this, arguments, or new.target). Instead, they lexically inherit super from their 
   enclosing scope.
   Example: 
   class Parent{
    greet(){console.log("Hello parent")}
   }
   class Child extends Parent{
     constructor(){
         super(); // call the parent class method;
         this.sayHi = () => {
             super.greet(); //again call parent class method
             console.log("Hi from the child");
         }
      }
   }
  const c = new Child();
  c.sayHi(); //this thing work without an error because the constructor has super.

Q: Can arrow functions be recursive?
A: Yes, arrow functions can be recursive, but since they are anonymous by default, recursion requires either:
 i) Assigning them to a variable, or ii)Using a Named Function Expression.
Exmaple: 
const fact = (num) => {
    if(num<=1) {return 1;}
    return num * fact(num-1);
}
console.log(fact(5)); //120

Q: What is the Arrow function return rules?
A: With parentheses () → implicit return, The expression inside is returned automatically, no need for the return keyword.
   Example: const square = (x) => (x*x);
            console.log(square(5)); //25

   With curly braces {} → explicit return required, Curly braces create a block body so you must use return to send back     a value.
   Example: const square = (x) => {return x * x;}
            console.log(square(5)) //25

   Special case: returning objects, Wrap the object in parentheses (), otherwise {} is treated as a block body.
   Example: const obj = () => ({name : "bob";})
            console.log(obj());

Q: Do they have a prototype?
A: No, the prototype in js is a special property of function that enables inheritance when those functions are used as a constructor. Arrow function do not have their own "prototype" because they are not constructor and cannot be invoked with the new.

Q: Can arrow functions be used in event handlers?
A: Yes, arrow function can be used in event handlers. However "this" inside the arrow function does not refer to the element that triggered the event. Instead the arrow function inherit "this" lexically from their surrounding scope. 
Example: <button class="btn">Click</buton>
let btn = document.querySelector(".btn");
btn.addEventListener("click", function(){
    console.log("Normall function");
    console.log(this); //<button class="btn">Click</buton>
})
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Arrow function");
    console.log(this); //window object
})

 Q: Do arrow functions support method shorthand?
 A: No, Arrow functions do not support method shorthand syntax in object or classes, arrow function must be assigned as a  property not the shorthand. 
 Method shorthand: is a special syntax that is used for defining the methods inside objects/classes without the function keyword.
 Example:
 //Normall function 
 const obj = {
 greet(){ console.log("hello") } //method shorthand
 }
 // Arrow function 
 const obj = {
 greet : () => { console.log("Hrllo"); } // arrow function assigned as a property
 }
 
 Q: What is a rest parameter?
 A: The rest parameter(...) in Js allows a function to accept an indefinite numbers of arguments in the form of array. if we are using the normall parameter and rest parameter than the rest paramter must be the last parameter. They replace the older arguments object with a cleaner, moder syntax. they collect the arguments in the form of an array.
Example: 
function fun(a, b, ...rest){
  console.log(a) //1
  console.log(b) //2
  console.log(rest) //[3, 4, 5]
}
fun(1,2,3,4,5);

Q: What is the difference between arguments and rest parameters?
A: arguments object
An array‑like object available inside all regular functions.
Contains all arguments passed to the function, regardless of how many parameters are declared.
Not available in arrow functions.
Does not support array methods directly (needs conversion to a real array).

Rest parameters (...)
A modern ES6 feature that collects remaining arguments into a real array.
Declared explicitly in the function signature (function f(...args)).
Works in both regular and arrow functions.
Supports array methods directly (map, filter, reduce, etc.).

Q: What is function composition? 
A: Function composition in JavaScript means combining multiple small functions to build a bigger function, where the output of one function becomes the input of the next.
Example: // without the composition
function square(num){ return num * num;}
function add(num){ return num + num;}

const result = square(add(5));
console.log(result);

Exmaple: // With Composition
function compose(f, g){
    return function(num){
        return f(g(num));
    }
}
function square(num){ return num * num;}
function add(num){ return num + num;}
const result = compose(square, add);
console.log(result(5));

Q: What is function Constructor? 
A: A function constructor in JavaScript is a way to dynamically create new function. Unlike normall function decleration or expression, the function constructor take string as a argument and always creates the function that executes in the global scope.
Exmaple: const fun = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");
console.log(fun(2,1));

Why We Don’t Commonly Use the Function Constructor: 

1.Global Scope Only: 
Functions created with new Function() don’t close over local variables.
They always run in the global scope, which breaks encapsulation and makes code harder to reason about.

2.Security Risks:
Since the function body is passed as a string, it’s similar to eval().
If the string comes from user input, it can lead to code injection attacks.

3.Performance Issues:
The JavaScript engine has to parse the string at runtime to create the function.
This is slower and less optimized compared to normal function declarations or expressions.

4.Readability & Maintainability:
Writing function bodies as strings makes code harder to read, debug, and maintain.
IDEs and linters can’t easily catch errors inside string‑based code.

## Array Related Question ##

Q: Expalin the array method unshift, shift, push and pop?
A: push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
   Returns: The new length of the array.

   pop(): Remove the last element from an array.
   Returns: The removed elements.

   ushift(): Add one or more elements to the beginning of an Array.
   Returns: The new length of the array.

   shift(): Removes the first element from an array.
   Returns: the removed elements.

Q: What does arr.includes(value) do? 
A: Returns true if the array contains the value. 

Q: What is indexOf() used for? 
A: Returns the first index of a value, or -1 if not found. 

Q: What is lastIndexOf()? 
A: Returns the last index of a value. 

Q: How to join array elements into a string? 
A: arr.join(", ") 

Q: What does arr.toString() do? 
A: Converts the array to a comma-separated string. 

Q: How to sort an array? 
A: Using the array arr.sort() method. Changes reflected in the orignal array. By default It sorts alphabetically unless a compare function is used. for sorting numberic we have to use => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); 

Q: What does splice() do? 
A: Adds/removes items at a specific index. 

Q: What does slice() do? 
A: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array. 

Q: What is the difference between slice() and splice()? 
A: slice() doesn't modify the original array; splice() does.

Q: Can forEach() break the loop?
A: No, The forEach() method in JavaScript cannot be broken or stopped early using break, continue, or return. Once started, forEach() will always iterate through the entire array.

Q: What is find()? 
A: Returns the first element that matches a condition. 
Example: const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const result = numbers.find(num => num > 25);
console.log(result); // 30

Q: What is findIndex()? 
A: Returns the index of the first matching element. 
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const index = numbers.findIndex(num => num > 25);
console.log(index); // 2

Q: What is every()? 
A: Returns true if all elements match a condition. 

Q: What is some()? 
A: Returns true if at least one element matches a condition. 

Q: What is Array.of()? 
A: Creates an array from given arguments. 
Exmaple: const arr2 = Array.of(1, 2, 3); console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3]

Q: What is fill()? 
A: Fills all or part of the array with a static value. Syntax: fill(value, start, end)
Example: const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.fill(0, 1, 3); 
console.log(arr); // [1, 0, 0, 4]

Q: What is copyWithin()? 
A: Copies part of the array to another location in the same array. in the same array, overwriting existing values. Syntax: copyWithin(target, start, end)
Example: const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = arr.copyWithin(0, 3); 
console.log(a); //[4, 5, 3, 4, 5]

Q: What is a sparse array? 
A: Some indices are missing values, so the array has gaps.

Q: Can you skip values during destructuring? 
A: Yes: let [,,c] = [1, 2, 3];

Q: How to create an array with N elements?
A: Using Array() constructor
Example: let arr = Array(5);
console.log(arr); //[<5 empty items>]
let arr1 = Array(5).fill(0);
console.log(arr1); //[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Q: What is the use of Array.prototype? 
A: By adding the method to (Array.prototype) we can make those methods available to all arrays in your program.
Example: Array.prototype.last = function() {
  return this[this.length - 1]; };

const nums = [10, 20, 30];
console.log(nums.last()); // 30

Q: What is Array.prototype.every.call()?
A: Array.prototype.every is the built‑in method that checks if all elements of an array satisfy a condition.
.call() is a way to invoke a function with a specific "this value".
So, Array.prototype.every.call() lets you use the every method on array‑like objects (objects that aren’t true arrays, like arguments or NodeList).

Example:
function checkAllEven() {
  // 'arguments' is array-like, not a real array
  return Array.prototype.every.call(arguments, num => num % 2 === 0);
}

console.log(checkAllEven(2, 4, 6)); // true
console.log(checkAllEven(2, 3, 6)); // false

Q: What is an array-like object?
A: An object with Indexed properties. They have a length property that indicates the number of elements. They not inherit from Array.prototype so built in array methods aren't avaliable. ex arguments objects inside functions.
Example: 
function demo(a, b, c){
    console.log(arguments[0]); //1
    console.log(arguments.length); //3
    console.log(arguments.push("4")); //Error arguments is not real array so we can't use array methods with it.
}
demo("1", "2", "3");

Q: How to convert arguments to array?
A: 1. using Array.from()
   Example: let args = Array.from(arguments);
   2. Using spread operator [...]
   Exmaple: let args = [...arguments];

Q: What’s the output of [1,2] + [3,4]?
A: "1,23,4" because arrays are converted to strings, then concatenated.  
   In JavaScript, the + operator is not array concatenation.For arrays, it first converts them to strings using .toString().
[1,2].toString() → "1,2"
[3,4].toString() → "3,4"

Q: What is the output of [,,,]? 
A: A sparse array with 3 empty slots. 

Q: Can an array have undefined values? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What happens if you delete an element using delete 
arr[1]? 
A: Leaves a hole (sparse array), doesn’t reduce length. 

Q: Best way to remove an element by index? 
A: arr.splice(index, 1)

Q: How to fill array with sequential numbers? 
A: let arr = Array.from({length: 5}, (_, i) => i+1);
console.log(arr);

Q: What does arr.at(-1) do?
A: The .at() method returns the element at a given index. Unlike the traditional arr[i] .at() supports negative indices. So arr.at(-1) returns the last element of the array.

Q: What is the spread operator used for in arrays?
A: Spread operator (...) expands arrays into individual elements —> perfect for copying, merging, passing arguments, or converting array‑like objects.

Q: Can you use map() on an empty array?
A: You can use map() on an empty array, but the result is still empty. On sparse arrays, holes are skipped.
Example: 
const arr = [1, , 3]; // hole at index 1
const result = arr.map(x => 10);
console.log(result); // [10, , 10]

Q: Can you assign properties to an array like arr.name = "x"?
A: Yes, arrays can have custom properties because they’re objects, However, these properties are not part of the array elements and won’t affect its length or iteration over numeric indices.
Exmaple: 
let arr = [1,2,3];
arr.name = "x";
console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, name: 'x' ]
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i]); //1,2,3
}
console.log(arr.length); //3
// for in loop 
for(let key in arr){
    console.log(key); //0,1,2,name
}
// for of loop
for(let value of arr){
    console.log(value); //1,2,3
}

Q: Is array.length always equal to number of elements? 
A: No, it can include empty slots. 
Example: let arr = [1,2,,3];
console.log(arr.length);

Q: What is the time complexity of push()? 
A: O(1) 

Q: What is the time complexity of splice()? 
A: O(n) in worst case.

## Object Related Question ##

Q: How do you check if a property exists?
A: let obj = {name : "varsha", age : 20}
   console.log("name" in obj);

Q: What is Object.keys(obj)? 
A: Returns an array of keys. 

Q: What is Object.values(obj)? 
A: Returns an array of values. 

Q: What is Object.entries(obj)? 
A: Returns an array of key-value pairs.

Q: Can object keys be numbers? 
A: Yes, but they are stored as strings.

Q: What is this inside an object method? 
A: Refers to the object itself.

Q: What does Object.assign() do? 
A: Copies properties from one or more objects to a target object.
Syntax: Object.assign(target, ...sources)
Example:
let obj = { name: "Varsha", age: 25 };
let obj1 = Object.assign({}, obj);
obj1.name = "Singh";
console.log(obj);  // { name: "Varsha", age: 25 }
console.log(obj1); // { name: "Singh", age: 25 }

Q: What is Object.freeze()? 
A: Makes an object immutable. You can not add, remove and update the property in the obj.

Q: What is Object.seal()? 
A: Prevents adding/removing properties but allows editing existing ones.

Q: What is a constructor function? 
A: A constructor function is a special type of function in js. That is used to create multiple similar objects with shared structure. It is called with the "new" keyword, they create a new object bind 'this' to that object, and return it automatically. Without the 'new' the function behave like a normall function. They are the foundation of object-oriented patterns in js.
Example: 
function User(name){
    this.name = name;
}
let u = new User("bob");
u.age = 20; //add property seperately
console.log(u); //User { name: 'bob', age: 20 }

Q: What does instanceof check? 
A: instanceof checks whether an object was created by a particular constructor.
Exmaple console.log(u instanceof User); //true

Q: What is hasOwnProperty()? 
A: Checks if a property exists directly on the object (not inherited). 
Exmaple: console.log(u.hasOwnProperty("age")); //true
console.log(u.hasOwnProperty("toString")); //false (inherited fromObject prototype)
