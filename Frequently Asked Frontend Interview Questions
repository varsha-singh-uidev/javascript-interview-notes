## Most Frequently Asked Frontend Interview Question ##

## HTML ##
1. What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.
Ans = Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning and purpose to both the browser and developers(<header>, <footer> etc).
      They improve: Accessibility, SEO, Code readability.

2. Difference between block, inline, and inline-block elements?
Ans = Block: Takes full width, starts on a new line. Example: <div>, <p>.
      Inline: Fits only the content, doesn’t start a new line. Example: <span>, <a>.
      Inline-block: Behaves like inline but allows setting width/height. Example: <img>.

3. What is the difference between <div> and <span>?
Ans = <div>: Block-level, starts from the new line, used to group larger sections of content.
      <span>: Inline-level, doesn't start from the new line, used to style or mark small parts of text.

4. What are HTML5 new features?
Ans = Key additions:
      Semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, <article>
      Multimedia: <audio>, <video>
      Graphics: <canvas>, <svg>
      APIs: Geolocation, Drag & Drop, Web Storage
      Form enhancements: email, date, required, placeholder.

5. Difference between HTML and XHTML?
Ans = HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
      Introduced: 1991 by Tim Berners‑Lee.
      Flexible rules: Browsers forgive small mistakes (like unclosed tags).
      Case-insensitive: Tags can be uppercase or lowercase.
      Attributes: Quotes around attribute values are optional.
      Goal: Easy to write, more forgiving for developers.

<!-- Valid in HTML -->
<p>Hello World
<br>

    XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)
    Introduced: January 26, 2000 (XHTML 1.0 by W3C).
    Strict rules: Must follow XML syntax.
    Case-sensitive: Tags must be lowercase.
    Well-formed: Every tag must be properly closed (<br /> instead of <br>).
    Attributes: Values must always be quoted.
    Goal: Cleaner, consistent code and well‑formed documents.

<!-- Required in XHTML -->
<p>Hello World</p>
<br />

6. Difference between id and class?
Ans = (id)
      Unique identifier for a single element.
      Can’t be reused on multiple elements in the same page.
      Used when you want to target one specific element.
      Higher CSS priority.
      Example: <h1 id="main-title">Welcome</h1>

      (class)
      Can be applied to multiple elements.
      Useful for grouping and styling many elements together.
      Often used with CSS and JavaScript for shared behavior.
      Lower CSS priority.
      Example: <p class="highlight">First paragraph</p>

7. Difference between relative, absolute, and fixed URLs?
Ans = Relative URL
      Definition: Points to a file relative to the current page’s location.
      Use: Shorter, depends on where the file is stored.
      Example: If your page is in a folder, and the image is in the same folder, you just say: <img src="logo.png">

      Absolute URL

      Use: Always points to the same resource, no matter where the page is.
      Example: This is the full address of something on the internet. <img src="https://example.com/images/logo.png">

      Fixed URL
      Definition: A fixed URL is a link that always points to the same place on a website, no matter where the page is.
      Use: Tied to a specific location, less flexible.
      Example: Starts from the root (home) of the website. <img src="/images/logo.png">

8. What are data-* attributes used for?
Ans = Definition: data-* attributes are custom attributes in HTML used to store extra information about an element without
      affecting the layout and behavior.
      Purpose: They let developers add small bits of data to HTML elements, which can later be accessed with JavaScript.

      Example: <button data-user-id="123">Click</button>
               const btn = document.querySelector("button");
               console.log(btn.dataset.userId);

9. Difference between <script>, <script async>, and <script defer>?
Ans = <script>
      Default behavior: Browser stops loading the page, runs the script immediately, then continues.
      Effect: Can block page rendering if the script is large.

      <script async>
      Behavior: Script loads in the background while the page continue loading.
      Effect: Once Script loads it runs it immediately(may interrupt page rendering).

      <script defer>
      Behavior: Scripts load in the background but waits untill the Html is fully parsed.
      Effect: Script runs after the page is ready.

10. Difference between <link> and @import for CSS?
Ans = (Link)
      where is used: It is used inside the Html.
      Deffination: It is an Html tag that is used to include the external CSS file.
      Behaviour: It loads CSS file while the page loads(faster).
      Support: It is widely supported.
      Best for: Modern Website.

      (@import)
      where is used: It is used inside the CSS file.
      Deffination: A CSS rule used inside the stylesheet to import another CSS file.
      Behavior: CSS loads after the page loads(slower).
      Support: It is less Supported.
      Best for: Rarely used today.

11. What are meta tags in HTML?
Ans = Meta tag in the html gave the metadata about the page. They describe the character encoding, 
      viewport setting, page description and author of the page. Always placed in the <head> element.
      Not visible to user, but important for the SEO, accessiblity, and browser behaviour.

12. Difference between <canvas> and <svg>?
Ans = (Canvas):
      i) Canvas is pixels based. zooming can make it blurry.
      ii) Shapes are not stored as an element.
      iii) Better for the things that change a lot like gaming or animation.
      iv) Not scalable

      (svg):
      i) Svg is vector-based. zooming keeps it sharp.
      ii) Each Shape is an  element in the DOM.
      iii)Better for the static graphics like icons, diagram etc.
      iv) Scalable - Show good at any size.

13. Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?
Ans = localStorage
      Definition: Stores data in the browser permanently (until manually cleared).
      Lifetime: Data stays even after closing the browser or restarting the computer.
      Size limit: Around 5–10 MB (much larger than cookies).
      Use case: Saving user preferences, themes, or app state.

      sessionStorage
      Definition: Stores data only for the current browser tab/session.
      Lifetime: Data is lost when the tab or browser is closed.
      Size limit: Similar to localStorage (~5 MB).
      Use case: Temporary data like form inputs or session‑specific state.

      Cookies
      Definition: Small pieces of data stored in the browser and sent to the server with every request.
      Lifetime: Can be temporary (session cookies) or persistent (with an expiry date).
      Size limit: Much smaller (~4 KB).
      Use case: Authentication, tracking, server communication.

14. What are accessibility (ARIA) attributes? Why important?
Ans = ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet Application) attribute are the extra html attribute that make the   
      website usable for the peaple with disablity. They provide the information to the technologies 
      like (screen readers) about the roles, states and relationships of elements.
      Example = <button aria-label="Button">Click</button>

15. Difference between <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <main>?
Ans = <main>: The main content of the page, Only one <main> per page. 
      <section>: A part of the page that groups the related content.
      <article>: A block of content that can stand alone.
      <aside>: Extra content on the side.

## CSS ##

1. Difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning with example?
Ans = Relative: The element stays in the normal document flow, but you can shift it using(top, left, right or bottom).
      Absolute: It removes from the normal flow, and positioned relative to nearest position ancestor.
      Fixed: Position relative to the viewport, Stays fixed on the screen even when scrolling.
      Sticky: Acts relative untill a scroll threshold, then behave like fixed.

2. What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS?
Ans = Inline CSS: Written directly inside the html element using the style attribute, affects only that single element,
      It is hard to maintain in large projects Example = <p style="color:red;">Hello</p>

      Internal CSS: Written inside the <style> tag in the <head> of the html file, Affects only that single html page.
      It is not reusable accross multiple pages.
      Example = <style> p{color : red;}  </style>

      External CSS: Written inside the seperate .css file and linked with the html using the <link> tag, Can style multiple
      pages at once, Best for performance and maintainablity. 
      Example = <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

3. Difference between relative units and absolute units (%, em, rem, vw, vh, px)?
Ans = Relative Units: It is responsive units means, they scale with the context(like parent size, root fontsize or viewport).
      Example of units are:
   a) %(percentage): Relative to parent element.
      Example = div { width: 50%; } /* Half of parent’s width */
   b) em: Relative to the parent font size.
      Example = p { font-size: 2em; } /* Twice parent’s font size */
   c) rem: Relative to the root(html) font size.
      Example = p { font-size: 1.5rem; } /* 1.5 × root font size */
   d) vw: Relative to the width of the browser window.
      Example = div { width: 50vw; } /* 50% of viewport width */
   e) vh: Relative to the height of the browser window.
      Example = div { width: 100vh; } /* Full viewport height */
